# Machine-Learning-Translator
This is the repository where I will be putting the (mostly) jupyter notebooks I will be working on my Japanese to English translator

I used https://github.com/404-novel-project/novel-downloader to download the JP web novels and https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webtoepub/akiljllkbielkidmammnifcnibaigelm for downloading the english web novels

For software needed for this project:
Python >= 3.10
Transformers
datasets
etc
